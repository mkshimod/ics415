        <h4 class="q" id="q1">(<span class="sign">+</span>) What's the difference between 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows?</h4>

        <div class="faq" id="faq1">
            The terms 32-bit and 64-bit refer to the way a computer's processor (also called a CPU) handles information. The 64-bit version of Windows handles large amounts of random access memory (RAM) more effectively than a 32-bit system. Not all devices can run the 64-bit versions of Windows.

        <h4 class="q" id="q2">(<span class="sign">+</span>) How do I find my Windows Product Key?</h4>

        <div class="faq" id="faq2">
            If you have a Windows operating system installed, open File Explorer or This PC.
             <ul>
                 <li>Right click on This PC or Computer in the navigation pane and select Properties.</li>
                 <li>In the System information screen, find the System type entry. This will indicate what type of processor your device has. </li>
             </ul>
            If you do not have an operating system installed, you should refer to the documentation that came with the device. Most device and processor
            manufacturers also provide information regarding processor capabilities on their websites.

        <h4 class="q" id="q3">(<span class="sign">+</span>) I purchased my copy of Windows through a University. Can I download it here?</h4>

        <div class="faq" id="faq3">
            The product key is located inside the product packaging, on the receipt or confirmation page for a digital purchase or in a confirmation e-mail that shows you purchased Windows. If you purchased a digital copy from Microsoft Store, you can locate your product key in your Account under Digital Content.
        </div>

        <h4 class="q" id="q4">(<span class="sign">+</span>) My Windows 7 Product Key won't verify.  What's the problem?</h4>

        <div class="faq" id="faq4">Yes, but youâ€™ll need your product key. Go to the Academic Products download page and select the version of Windows to begin.</div>

        <h4 class="q" id="q5">(<span class="sign">+</span>) I've downloaded an ISO file, now what?</h4>

        <div class="faq" id="faq5">
            The most common issue is the use of a product key for a product not currently supported by the site such as an Upgrade key, an MSDN key, product keys for pre-installed media or an Enterprise edition key. For access to MSDN products or Enterprise edition visit the MSDN Portal or the Volume Licensing Service Center. Upgrades and pre-installed media are not currently supported by the tools on the site.
